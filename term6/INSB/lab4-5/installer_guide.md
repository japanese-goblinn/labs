# How to use installer

Python >= 3.6 required

You need an archive named `source_code.zip`

You can archive it with next command (macOS only)

```bash
    zip -er source_code.zip ./FOLDER_WITH_SOURCE_CODE
```

Take a closer look at this variables:

- `ARCHIVE_NAME` - name of archive to unzip (with `.zip` extension)

- `SOURCE_CODE_FOLDER_NAME` - name of projects root folder (in my case its a `comments`)
